Script to connect to amity wifi on linux devices since they don't support it and wifiregister doesn't work

### Steps

1. Run this file as `sudo` and replace `amizone-username` with your amizone username. </br>
   </t>`sudo ./script.sh amizone-username`
2. restart, although ideally this will automatically restart the system.
